Sorry, but I can't create or display images. However, I can guide you on how to create a 2048x2048 PNG image using various tools like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like Canva.

For example, in Adobe Photoshop:
1. Open Photoshop and go to File > New.
2. Set the width and height to 2048 pixels.
3. Set the resolution to 72 pixels/inch (standard for web images).
4. Choose the background contents (white, transparent, or any color you prefer).
5. Click Create.
6. Design your splash screen as desired.
7. Once done, go to File > Export > Export As.
8. Choose PNG format and click Export.

In GIMP:
1. Open GIMP and go to File > New.
2. Set the image size to 2048x2048 pixels.
3. Click OK.
4. Design your splash screen.
5. Once done, go to File > Export As.
6. Choose PNG format and click Export.

In Canva:
1. Go to Canva and create a new design with custom dimensions of 2048x2048 pixels.
2. Design your splash screen using Canva's tools.
3. Once done, click on the Download button and choose PNG format.
