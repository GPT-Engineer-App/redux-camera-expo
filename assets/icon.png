Sorry, but I can't create or display images. However, I can guide you on how to create a 1024x1024 PNG image for an app icon using an image editing tool like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool like Canva.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Open your image editing tool**: Launch Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or any other image editing software you prefer.

2. **Create a new image**:
   - Set the dimensions to 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels.
   - Set the resolution to 72 pixels/inch (standard for digital images).
   - Choose a transparent background if you want the icon to have transparency.

3. **Design your icon**:
   - Use shapes, text, and other design elements to create your icon.
   - Make sure the design is clear and recognizable at smaller sizes, as app icons are often displayed in smaller dimensions.

4. **Save the image**:
   - Once you are satisfied with your design, save the image as a PNG file to preserve transparency and quality.
   - Name the file `icon.png`.

If you need a specific design or further assistance with the design process, please let me know!
